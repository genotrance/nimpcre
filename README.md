Nimpcre is a [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) wrapper for the [PCRE](https://github.com/svn2github/pcre) library.

While PCRE is already available within Nim, this module makes it easy to statically compile PCRE into the resulting binary instead of relying on an external DLL or binary.

Nimpcre is distributed as a [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) package and depends on [nimgen](https://github.com/genotrance/nimgen) and [c2nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/c2nim/) to generate the wrappers. The PCRE source code is downloaded using Git so having ```git``` in the path is required.

__Installation__

Nimpcre can be installed via [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble):

```
> nimble install nimgen

> git clone https://github.com/genotrance/nimpcre
> cd nimpcre
> nimble install
```

This will download, wrap and install nimpcre in the standard Nimble package location, typically ~/.nimble. Once installed, it can be imported into any Nim program.

__Usage__

Module documentation can be found [here](http://nimgen.genotrance.com/nimpcre).

```nim
import nimpcre

import re

echo "abc".match(re"a.+")
```

NOTE: The `-d:usePcreHeader` flag needs to be specified to the nim compiler in order to remove the dependency on the external DLL. This can also be accomplished by using a `nim.cfg` or `test.cfg` in the same directory as the code being compiled.

```
nim c -d:usePcreHeader -r test.nim
```

Refer to the ```tests``` directory for examples on how the library can be used.

__Credits__

Nimpcre wraps the PCRE source code and all licensing terms of [PCRE](https://github.com/svn2github/pcre/blob/master/LICENCE) apply to the usage of this package.

Credits go out to [c2nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/c2nim/) as well without which this package would be greatly limited in its abilities.

__Feedback__

Nimpcre is a work in progress and any feedback or suggestions are welcome. It is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/genotrance/nimpcre) with an MIT license so issues, forks and PRs are most appreciated.
